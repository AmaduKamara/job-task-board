> Give credit to WebDevSimplify for the project design.

I would like to give credit to WebDevSimplify as I got inspiration from his project designed for his new course on React and NextJS that's expected to be launched on July 31 2023. I used to opportunity to design and develop the app UI and its features to challenge myself before the course is actually out. I can't wait to subscribe to his course as he is one of the best React developers out there. 👍🏽
